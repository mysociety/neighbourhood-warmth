            Three priorities: 1) understand the house, 2) reduce energy use, 3) decarbonise energy supply

            Why understand the house together? – 1) small cost savings out of efficiency of multiple surveys in one go, 2) discussing and understanding the surveys together, with people in houses like yours, 3) potential future group buying discounts on retrofit actions/supplies

            Can we evidence why it’s better to not go alone?

        <p>Home energy can be complicated, especially if you’re trying to figure it out alone.</p>

        <p>Neighbourhood Warmth helps people to form teams around shared home energy challenges, such as these: [youtube video]</p>

        <p>Each challenge is broken down into simple steps, with personalised advice.</p>

        <p>The first challenge involves getting to know your home. Once completed you should have a clearer idea of:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>home energy improvements you could make</li>
            <li>ways to prioritise and plan these</li>
            <li>how long they typically take</li>
            <li>what they might cost</li>
        </ul>

        <p>See for example: [youtube video]</p>

        <p>We ask you to complete our challenges with a team of people who live near you, in houses similar to yours, because that way you’re more likely to share common problems and solutions. Plus, it’s more fun!</p>
